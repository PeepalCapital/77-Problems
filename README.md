**Problem 1**

It is a poorly stated problem. Maybe something got lost in translation. Do Masha and Misha want the same books? I guess that assumption is true.
Masha wants a book priced a. Misha wants a book priced b. They have (a - 7) and (b - 1) respectively.
So the inequality assuming

a = b = x

is

x > 2x - 8

thus

x < 8

Now Masha is 7 short of the cost. If the book was priced at any positive number below 7 (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) then Masha would have had to be in debt.
Therefore, book is priced at 7. Masha has 0 and Misha has 6.

Also these are integer solutions.
